                <p>I was born and raised in Tomball, TX – just 30 minutes north of Houston with my older brother Matthew. My parents are originally from Green Bay, Wisconsin, but moved to Houston for my mother’s medical residency – beginning my father’s career at Compaq/HP as an electrical engineer.<br>

                <br>I grew up playing soccer and piano, participating in Boy Scouts, video gaming,  and essentially “messing around” with computers – building my first desktop computer in 8th grade. Naturally, I had always assumed that I would grow up to be an engineer, but that certainty soon wavered.<br>

                <br>Freshman and sophomore year of high school, I played goalie on my school’s soccer team, ran cross country, and sang in choir – inspiring my dive into the arts. My sophomore year, I joined theatre, competitive one-act play, speech and debate, and chamber choir. After experiencing success in competitive acting and choir - placing 16th in the nation for duet acting at <a href="http://nietoc.com/" target="_blank">NIETOC</a> and 8th tenor in the state at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd0aLBTaJWw" target="_blank">TPSMEA</a> , I decided to seriously pursue the arts as a career. This prompted me to training at <a href="https://drama.cmu.edu/programs/summer-pre-college/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a> and the <a href="http://gatelypoole.com/" target="_blank">Gately/Poole Conservatory</a> in Chicago during my summer and winter breaks of 2016. Split between my two longtime passions, when college decisions came, I was between acting at the University of California Irvine or engineering at Texas A&M. As you may have assumed, I ended up choosing engineering.<br>

                <br>While I do still love acting, I have many other passions which I have been able to pursue in college. Outside of school, if I’m not working at <a href="https://www.heb.com/" target="_blank">HEB</a>, I love to sing, play piano and guitar, shoot photography, play soccer, serve the community, go camping, and travel; I plan to study abroad in Spain this summer!</p>
