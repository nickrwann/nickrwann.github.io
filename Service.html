                    <p>BAM is a men’s organization on the campus of Texas A&M University which serves the Bryan and College Station community through mentorship by developing leaders of character who uphold the core values of Texas A&M. Mentorship as simply actively seeking to invest in another person.<br>

                    <br> We believe that mentorship can take place nearly anywhere; a game of ultimate frisbee, a study hall, or even over a shared meal. Bryan High School is our primary source of outreach, meaning that we host events directly geared towards these 9-12th grade students. During the week, we TA in the school and attend school lunches and sports games. On the weekends, we hosts events like pickup basketball, football, and ultimate frisbee tournaments.<br>

                    <br>However, we affirm and support successful mentorship relationships that occur outside of Bryan H.S. as well.

                    <p>Impact Retreat is a 4-day retreat designed to connect freshman to churches and ministries that will provide lasting community on the foundation of Christ and the Gospel. Essentially, Impact is a Christian Fish Camp for freshman.<br>

                    <br>In the semester prior to retreat, I interviewed and then trained to be a counselor. This consisted of weekly 2 hours training meetings, 2 weekend retreats, and other more spontaneous hangouts in order to get to know our fellow counselors. We were then split into guy/girl partnerships, creating a family-like atmosphere for the freshman.<br>

                    <br>The week before retreat, all the counselors arrived in college station and prepared to welcome the freshman. When the freshman arrived, each partnership got a “family” which served throughout the four days counseling, entertaining, and welcoming to the University!</p>

I’ve served as a student participant in 6th-12th grade and afterwards as leader and photographer.</p>
