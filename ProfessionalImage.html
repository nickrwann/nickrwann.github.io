                        <p>After my freshman year, I had the opportunity to intern as a data scientist at a startup company in the Woodlands, TX called <a href="https://www.thoughttrace.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtTrace</a>. ThoughTrace uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze oil and gas leases and provides insights accordingly.<br>

                        <br>During my internship, I participated in SCRUM and completed multiple projects on a need-by-need basis. (1) I centralized and optimized the data labeling system by creating a web application which held all the labeling additions, allowing ThoughtTrace to outsource the labeling process. (2) I validated model enhancements by comparing the results from the old and new model in order to provide QA feedback. (3) I validated the UI by creating a web application to provide the current ontology of classifications for the front-end developers to utilize. And (4) I created a dictionary to increase model accuracy by decreasing the input cardinality, increasing the OCR accuracy by more than 10%. These projects helped the company roll out model 2.0 of “ThoughtTrace” more efficiently.</p>

                        <p>Having grown up with computers and problem-solving, I was naturally led to computer engineering. This was first sparked by my interest in computer science: a field with endless application. Although I do find data science and machine learning fascinating, I want to explore more applications before settling into a data science role. I have not had much real-world application of software development and engineering – which is something I would like to experience. Therefore, I am currently looking for a Summer 2020 software development internship so that I can explore a different side of computer science.<br>

                        <br>Upon the completion of my undergraduate career in May 2021, I would like to pursue a job which actively creates a better community and world around me. My core instinct is to solve problems and improve efficiency, and I believe this could best be done through interaction with the medical industry. I grew up going to hospitals and nursing homes with my mother, a doctor, which developed a fascination with the relationship between technology and medicine. This relationship is explored ever more as technology grows, but the potential for technological application in the medical field is endless – especially with recent developments in prosthetics and charting software.
